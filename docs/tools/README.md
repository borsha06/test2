We have discussed about all the terms we need to install VuePress, Now it's time to talk about how we can develop our custom themes easily or generate static site based on the default theme, That is when we need tools. There are several tools we have available.<br>
But we will talk how we can develop our code using <strong> Visual Studio Code </strong> <br>
## Visual Studio Code

Now to work with VuePress we need to install some extensions so that they can help us writing code with more fun,error free and make our development related tasks stress free.
We will talk about two extensions.

<p> <strong> Vue peek </strong>

## Vetur
